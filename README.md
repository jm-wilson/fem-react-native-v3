> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hi! This repo contains all of my code as I worked through the [React Native, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-native-v3/) course on Frontend Masters.  Each batch of changes is loosely aligned with one of the course's exercises, but these changes are not identical to the course's content.
> 
> My approach to learning often involves following various rabbit holes when I want to understand something better, and cutting other corners when I think I understand them well enough.  While my code in this repo is public for all to see, I would recommend taking the course on Frontend Masters and finding your own rabbit holes to follow (and corners to cut!) to suit your own learning journey.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
